# n8n_AI_Automation
Built an automation assistant using n8n that connects WhatsApp, Google Drive, and Gemini AI. Users can send WhatsApp commands (LIST, DELETE, UPLOAD, MOVE, RENAME, SUMMARY) to manage Google Drive files. The workflow responds with results in WhatsApp and uses Gemini AI to summarize/analyze folder contents.
